The Linear Regression intiution building workbook is divided in to two parts. The first part explores the Gradient Descent methodology by buidling the cost function and iteratively reduce the cost along the steepest descent path. 
The second part derives the Normal Equation formula and gives a linear algebra perspecive of projecting the target value in the column space.
